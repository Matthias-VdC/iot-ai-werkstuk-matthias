## Description
Arbitrary image stylization is an an AI that has been trained to be able to break down any image to stylize another image. With the use of this model https://github.com/reiinakano/arbitrary-image-stylization-tfjs I have applied this to 3d objects. By using a randomization factor and a random pattern the result becomes unique for every new stylization.
